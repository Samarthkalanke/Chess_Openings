## Scillian (Point Val)
If you got this point value on the test this is where you belong, the quiz showed that this is the opening that you should study for black. 
You are a very structual player that wants to get a better position and likes to read about openings alot. You like to play against higher than average elo players and like to study chess openings also this is my personal favorite so I officially love you and GothamChess is your daddy!!

Blobby — 05/15/2023 4:45 PM

INDIAN PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO USE THE N WORD
also that's just below us to go to a new country just to oppress new minorities
like come on
Cody miller from microsoft — 05/15/2023 4:53 PM
yea i can only say “stop” so many times till it’s obvious it doesn’t work
mandeepison bheer — 05/15/2023 7:31 PM
tbf when hispanic ppl say it its not with the intent of oppressing black ppl
LOLOL Bakalan Liu-sussy — 05/15/2023 7:50 PM
@shu eats curry @Snowman @The chosen one @Gamer101 is this where the stamps end

It ends at the second row with one empty space right
Snowman — 05/15/2023 7:59 PM
Yes
LOLOL Bakalan Liu-sussy — 05/15/2023 8:23 PM
Alr thx
Blobby — 05/15/2023 9:37 PM
yeah but we have privilege
yeah sure we get ridiculed by white people who take advantage of the fact that we're rather socially incompetent
mandeepison bheer — 05/15/2023 9:37 PM
not rlly compared to hispanics 
Blobby — 05/15/2023 9:37 PM
100% yes
mandeepison bheer — 05/15/2023 9:37 PM
especially white hispanics
Blobby — 05/15/2023 9:37 PM
the fact that you have more than 1 car and have a green card or citizenship shows that you have privilege
as compared to someone with potentially illegally-immigrated relatives or family members or friends
Blobby — 05/15/2023 9:38 PM
OH yeah this is a different story
mandeepison bheer — 05/15/2023 9:38 PM
like hispanics don't face that much racism at escondido hs/other predominantly hispanic hs compared to indian ppl at del norte
Blobby — 05/15/2023 9:38 PM
oh actually this is an interesting question
im sure that there are white teachers at escondido high that are nasty to their students
but then again I think the problem is that del norte's white people, as in the ones who are into athletics and stuff
want del norte to be your high school musical high school
and Indians are there to crash that
bc we're no fun if you don't actually break the shell and become friends with us
or even if we do try to be outgoing
we're not very obviously fun people or whatever
like quite literally only chase has made it in
mandeepison bheer — 05/15/2023 9:40 PM
no samarth has a lot of white friends
same with me lol
Blobby — 05/15/2023 9:40 PM
honestly I think there is a serious denial aspect behind the fact that most white supremacists have hispanic relatives
Blobby — 05/15/2023 9:41 PM
sus
mandeepison bheer — 05/15/2023 9:41 PM
thats also true lol
like the person that was in the dallas shooting was hispanic
Blobby — 05/15/2023 9:42 PM
like not to suggest that all colored ppl need to be democrat or anything, but it seems to me that people like Nick Fuentes, Enrique Tarrio, Candace Owens and Herschel Walker are the GOP's desperate attempt to prove that they are not oriented towards the interests of white semi- - rural americans
Blobby — 05/15/2023 9:42 PM
mm yeah
mandeepison bheer — 05/15/2023 9:43 PM
yea exactly
